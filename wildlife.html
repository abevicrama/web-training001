                        is somewhat of an outlier when it comes to biodiversity. Experts
                        have
                        been studying the biodiversity of this small island since the early
                        20th
                        century, and all with good reason. The number of animal species in
                        the
                        island is said to be five times as much as it is supposed to be in
                        an
                        island of its size, and the number of endemic species in the country
                        is
                        amazing. From endemic birds to endemic primates, Sri Lanka has them
                        all.
                        The wonder of Sri Lanka – being such a small island – is that you

                        hunt.
                        With an indiscriminate diet, ranging from wild hares to deer,
                        leopards
                        survive the elements better than any other big cat in the world.
                        Although most species of leopards are known to carry their prey up
                        into
                        trees, Sri Lankan leopards take advantage of their position on top
